# Construction Website Authentication Setup

## Database Setup Required

Your authentication system is ready, but you need to set up the database first.

### Option 1: MySQL Setup (Recommended)
1. Install MySQL or XAMPP
2. Create a database named `inance_construction`
3. Update `.env` file:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=inance_construction
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Option 2: SQLite Setup (Easier)
1. Make sure PHP SQLite extension is enabled
2. Keep current `.env` settings:
```
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite
```

### Run Migrations
After database setup, run:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
